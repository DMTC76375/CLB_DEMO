# Zero-Software Ultrasonic Distance Sensing — Use Case for Configurable Logic Block (CLB) Using the PIC16F13145 Microcontroller with MCC Melody

This repository provides 2 projects that implement a rangefinder using the HC-SR04, and displaying the results on a eight LED's.

The CLB peripheral is a collection of logic elements that can be programmed to perform a variety of digital logic functions. The logic function may be completely combinatorial, sequential or a combination of the two, enabling users to incorporate hardware-based custom logic into their applications.

The HC-SR04 is a standard ultrasonic sensor that can be used for object detection and distance sensing. This is accomplished by the transmitter sending a signal, and making a calculation based off the time it took to get to the reciever.
